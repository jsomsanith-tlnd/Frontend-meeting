# Javascript challenge : compute the price

An online commercial website wants you to compute the total price of a shopping cart.
The details of the cart is provided as a string.
Example : `Jam, 4€; Salad cost 0.89; carrots, 3.4 ; black chocolate for 2.01`
* the example above should produce `10.30`
* an empty cart should produce `0`
 
## Implementation
Open price.js, the function to implement is `computePrice()`.
You can suppose that
* the list can only be a string
* the € sign is optional
* the price can be a integer or a decimal number
* the decimal sign is always `.`
* the product separator is always `;`
 
## To run your code
 ```
 > node price.js
 ```
